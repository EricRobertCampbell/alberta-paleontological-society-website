We have a new t-shirt design by our own President, ${president.name}!
</p> <p data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>In his own words,</p> <blockquote data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>
"The new t-shirt design is meant to celebrate the diversity
					of Alberta’s prehistory and connections with our
					neighbouring regions. Flanking the APS logo to the left and
					right are a <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai</em> from Pipestone
					Creek and a <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Bison latifrons</em>, the ice-age longhorn
					buffalo that ranged across North America. Beneath the <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Pachyrhinosaurus</em>
is <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Albertonectes vanderveldei</em> from the Bearpaw Formation,
					which is the world’s longest known elasmosaur. Beneath the
<em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Bison</em> are a representative rugose coral, brachiopod,
					and scaphite ammonite. Directly beneath the APS logo are stromatolites,
					referencing the 1.1-billion-year-old Siyeh Formation fossils
					found in the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park and Castle
					Wildland Provincial Park area. Above the <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Pachyrhinosaurus</em> is a giant lycopod tree like <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Lepidodendron</em> or <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Sigillaria</em>, representing the
<em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Stigmaria</em> site that used to exist in Canyon Creek. <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Stigmaria</em>
is the name assigned to the root fossils of these ancient lycopods.
					One of less than a handful of <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Stigmaria</em> sites in Canada,
					the site in Canyon Creek was apparently wiped out by the 2013
					floods. Above the <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Bison</em> is a <em data-astro-cid-gw3zcr6g>Metasequoia</em> tree,
					the leaves, twigs, and cones of which are common Late Cretaceous
					and Early Cenozoic fossils in Alberta. Between them is a volcano
					representing the 110-million-year-old eruption in the Cranbrook,
					B.C., area that deposited the Crowsnest Volcanics here in Alberta.
					Blairemorite is a rare volcanic rock known only from the Crowsnest
					Volcanics site in the Crowsnest Pass and the Lupata Gorge in
					Mozambique. The volcano is also a tribute to late APS member
					Phil Benham, who had a passion for climbing volcanoes around
					the world and passed away earlier this year."

The 2010 passing of Hope Johnson marked the end of an era
					for Alberta’s verte­brate palaeontology communities. Her
					death affected other disciplines, too, as she travelled in
					many circles within the province for 65 years. How many
					among us can truly say they never knew her personally, saw
					her art work, or learned to identify Alberta prairie plants,
					or Late Cretaceous bones and teeth through her fossil
					identification books? During much of her middle and later
					life, and especially during the late 1950s to 1980s, Hope
					was a well-known and respected powerhouse in the Albertan
					amateur and professional vertebrate palae­ontological
					communities. She was also heavily involved in the naturalist
					and visual arts communities as well as charitable
					organizations. This book focuses on her extensive activities
					in Alberta vertebrate palaeontology and provides examples of
					some of her fossil and botanical drawings and paintings.
					Coil bound, 283 pages; extensively illustrated in black and
					white, with 30-page colour section showcasing Hope Johnson’s
					art. Includes index.
