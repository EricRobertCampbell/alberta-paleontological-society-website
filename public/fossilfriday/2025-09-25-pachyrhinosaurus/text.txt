Beautiful growth series of upper arm bones (humerus) from Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai!

The Pipestone Creek bonebed, near Grande Prairie, contains the remains of thousands of these relatives of Triceratops. While tragic for them, it gives us a valuable opportunity to study a whole population, with juveniles, subadults, and adults of various ages represented. This exhibit, at the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum, makes that point eloquently!
