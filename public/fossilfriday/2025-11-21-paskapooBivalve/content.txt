A very accessible fossil! This bivalve (right) and gastropod shell impression (left) were found in Glenbow Ranch Provincial Park, just outside of Cochrane, AB.

These were found in a sandstone boulder from the Paskapoo Formation, dating from the early Palaeocene (right after the extinction of most of the dinosaurs).
