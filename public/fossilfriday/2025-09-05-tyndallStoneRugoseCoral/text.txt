In honour of tomorrow's fossil hunting field trip, here is a solitary rugose (horn) coral from a block of Tyndall stone in downtown Calgary! This one is from the late Ordovician, about 450 million years ago.

Rugose corals are named for their horn-like shape; what you see here is a cross section. They are very common fossils in downtown Calgary as well as in the Rocky Mountains. They went extinct in the end-Permian mass extinction, about 252 million years ago.
