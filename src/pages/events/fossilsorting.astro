	<p>
		Join us for exciting microfossil sorting sessions where you can help advance paleontological research while discovering tiny treasures from millions of years ago! These sessions are open to anyone interested in getting involved in palaeontology and provide a unique opportunity to work with microscopes and contribute to ongoing scientific research.
	</p>

	<section>
		<h2>About Our Fossil Sorting Sessions</h2>
		
		<p>
			Our microfossil sorting sessions are collaborative research activities where volunteers use microscopes to search for tiny fossils that aid the ongoing research of <a href="https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/jessica-theodor" target="_blank">Dr. Jessica Theodor</a> and <a href="https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/alex-dutchak" target="_blank">Dr. Alex Dutchak</a> at the University of Calgary. We examine matrix (soil) from various geological formations, including the Saskatchewan Cypress Hills Formation from the Middle Eocene period (about 50 million years old).
		</p>

		<p>
			These sessions take place at Mount Royal University, where we have access to high-quality microscopes and laboratory facilities. The work contributes directly to ongoing paleontological research, and all fossils found are kept by the University of Calgary for their research collection.
		</p>

		<h3>What to Expect</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Use microscopes to examine sediment samples</li>
			<li>Learn to identify microfossils from experienced volunteers</li>
			<li>Contribute to real scientific research at the University of Calgary</li>
			<li>Work in a friendly, supportive environment with other fossil enthusiasts</li>
			<li>Discover fossils that are millions of years old</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>What to Bring</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Tweezers or a small paint brush for picking tiny fossils</li>
			<li>A pen to label your finds</li>
			<li>Enthusiasm and patience for detailed work</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Requirements and Guidelines</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Age Restriction:</strong> Due to the delicate nature of this work, only participants 12 years and older are allowed</li>
			<li><strong>Experience:</strong> No prior experience is required - we welcome beginners!</li>
			<li><strong>Registration:</strong> While registration is not required, we recommend contacting our coordinator to confirm attendance</li>
			<li><strong>Research Contribution:</strong> All fossils found will be kept by the University of Calgary for their research</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Location</h3>
		<p>
			Sessions are held at <strong>Mount Royal University</strong> in their laboratory facilities. Room locations are specified for each session. Maps and parking information are available on the Mount Royal University website.
		</p>

		<p>
			We are very grateful to Mount Royal University for allowing us to use their microscopes and laboratory facilities for these important research activities.

	<h2>Registration and Contact</h2>

	<p>
		While registration is not required for fossil sorting sessions, we recommend letting our coordinator know if you're planning to attend. This helps us inform participants if we need to cancel a session due to unforeseen circumstances.
