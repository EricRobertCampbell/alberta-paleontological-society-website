	<p>
		This symposium will contain presentations from a mix of amateur and
		professional palaeontologists. The aim is to showcase palaeontology to
		the general public and to provide an opportunity for contact between the
		Alberta Palaeontological Society, industry, government and educational
		facilities. The event is free and all are welcome to attend or join
		virtually. Families are encouraged to bring fossils to our
		identification booth where APS members will do their best to provide you
		with information.
