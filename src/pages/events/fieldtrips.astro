		be given; however, you will receive the guide for the trip.
		Registrations are accepted on a first come first served basis so sign up
		early to avoid disappointment. For the 2025 field trips Keith will be
		sending you the waiver and medical forms along with the trip
		information. This information will be sent to you via email or Canada
		Post. Please ensure that your addresses are correct and legible when
		sending in registration forms. When you arrive at the meeting place
		please have all forms completed. All participants are required to have
