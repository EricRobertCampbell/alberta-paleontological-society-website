This week's Fossil Friday features a dicot leaf from the Paskapoo Formation sandstone, found in a neighbourhood in Calgary. The Paskapoo Formation dates from roughly 50 million years ago. This plant looks very similar to some of the species that can be found around Calgary today!

The Paskapoo sandstone is a common decorative rock around Calgary, and it's fairly common to find bivalve and plant fossils in it. Next time you see one of these distinctive rocks, take a look - you might just find a fossil!
