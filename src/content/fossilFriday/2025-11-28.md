Did you know that the first T. rex excavated in Canada is from Alberta? It comes from Huxley, right by Knudsen's farm! It was first discovered by famous fossil hunter Charlie Sternberg in 1946, but excavation wasn't finished until 1981!

While you can see it at the RTMP, it might also seem familiar as a cast appeared in a small indie film about dinosaurs - Jurassic Park!
