This week's Fossil Friday features a Composita brachiopod from the Banff Formation in Kananaskis. Brachiopods are marine invertebrates commonly mistaken for clams; in fact they are not closely related. They were abundant throughout the Paleozoic era, and Composita is a genus that persisted into the Permian period.

The Banff Formation is a Mississippian (Early Carboniferous) formation found in the Canadian Rockies. This formation represents a time when much of western North America was covered by a shallow tropical sea, providing ideal conditions for brachiopods and other marine life.

One of the fascinating features visible on this specimen is beekite, a type of preservation pattern that forms as concentric rings on fossil surfaces. This forms when the original material (usually calcite or aragonite) is replaced with silicate minerals. This replacement makes the fossils more resistant to erosion than the surrounding limestone, which is why these stand out so much!

Thanks to Howard Allen for help with identification and placing the fossils in context!
