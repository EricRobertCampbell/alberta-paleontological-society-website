      description: 'Placenticeras ammonite shell with mosasaur tooth marks and ammolite coloration'

A double for this week's fossil Friday!

This is a shell from an ammonite, an ancient relative of squids and octopuses. This shell, belonging to a Placenticeras, was found near Lethbridge and is about 75 million years old. At this time an inland sea covered most of the interior of North America, which is why marine fossils are so common!

This specimen is particularly fascinating for a few reasons. First is the line of tooth marks. These probably belonged to a mosasaur, an enormous, ocean-going relative of snakes and monitor lizards. Second, and most striking, is the colouration! Due to a unique process here in Alberta, some of these shells gain the beautiful colouration and sheen you can see here. They are now termed ammolite and are the provincial gemstone of Alberta!

This specimen is from the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology and is part of the new Breakthroughs exhibit!
