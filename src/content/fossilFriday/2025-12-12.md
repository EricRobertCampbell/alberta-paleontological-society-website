---

This week's Fossil Friday features a beautifully preserved bird track from Grande Cache, Alberta. The track shows clear impressions of three toes, characteristic of many bird species, both modern and extinct. This track is from the Albian (Lower Cretaceous) Gates Formation, near Grande Cache, and is about 110 million years old. This track is just one of many hundreds exposed by strip-mining coal in the region.

Grande Cache is known for its rich fossil record, particularly from the Early Cretaceous period. This track provides valuable information about the diversity of avian life that existed in Alberta millions of years ago. Trackways like this help paleontologists understand not only what species lived in an area, but also how they moved and interacted with their environment.

This fossil was found during our 2024 field trip to Grande Prairie and Grande Cache!
