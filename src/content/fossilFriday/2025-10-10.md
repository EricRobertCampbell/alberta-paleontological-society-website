      description: 'Hadrosaur fossil hoodoo in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation'
---

For this week's Fossil Friday, something a little different - a dinosaur hoodoo! This fossil, part of a hadrosaur, is more resistant to weathering than the surrounding rock. As the softer matrix erodes away, the fossil is left perched on its own pedestal. Found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, this hoodoo highlights the region's rapid erosion (sometimes up to 4 mm per year!) which continually exposes new fossils.

A hadrosaur fossil turned hoodoo! In the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, erosion (up to 4 mm/year) leaves tougher fossils standing tall as the softer rock wears away.
