We have some good news! Although the original deadline for registering
for the Dinovember sleep-in at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology
has passed, there is still room available, so we have extended the
registration deadline to **October 21**. As a reminder, this is a special
overnight sleep over at the RTMP which will take place from Friday,
November 22 - Saturday, November 23 for children aged 5 - 13 and their
adults.

Please note, however, that we have given up our reserved spaces, and
from this point forward, registrations will only be accepted as long as
there is room. Space may fill up unexpectedly, so I encourage you to
register as soon as possible if youâ€™re interested in attending.

If you have any questions or would like more details about the trip,
see the field trip page at https://albertapaleo.org/events/fieldtrips.

To sign up, use [this form](</fieldTrips/2024/rtmp-sleepin/RTMP - Field Trip Sign Up - Deadline Extended.pdf>). As space is limited, we are only accepting the first 20 registrants. Due to the nature of the event, only children between **5 - 13 years of age** and their adults can be accepted. The deadline for registration is **October 21**!</p>
