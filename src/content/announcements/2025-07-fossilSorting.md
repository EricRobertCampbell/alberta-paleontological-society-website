**Search for Microfossils this Fall, 2025**

by Mona Trick

Use microscopes to search for tiny fossils to aid the research of Dr. Jessica Theodor and Dr. Alex Dutchak of the University of Calgary. We will be examining the matrix (soil) from the Saskatchewan Cypress Hills Formation (Middle Eocene about 50 million years old). We will be using microscopes in room B140 at Mount Royal University from 1:00 until 3:30 pm. on the following Sundays:

- October 26, 2025
- November 2, 2025
- November 23, 2025

Registration is not required, but if you let Mona Trick (cell: <a href="tel:(587) 578-4579">(587) 578-4579</a> or giftshop@albertapaleo.org) know that you are planning to attend, then she can inform you if we need to cancel this session. No experience is required. Due to the delicate nature of this work, only those 12 years and older are allowed to search for the microfossils. Bring tweezers or a small paint brush to pick the tiny fossils from the soil and a pen to label your finds. All of the fossils found will be kept by the University of Calgary for their research.

We are very grateful to Mount Royal University for allowing us to use their microscopes and lab.

Check the APS website and December Bulletin for the dates of the microfossil sorting sessions in January and February, 2026, when we will be once again searching for tiny fossils.
