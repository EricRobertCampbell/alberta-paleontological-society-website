The Alberta Palaeontological Society welcomes CSPG (CEGA) members, families, and the general public to the December Christmas Social and Open House! The event will take place from 7:30PM - 9:00 PM in room B108 at Mount Royal University. For details on parking and how to get there, please see the [monthly meetings](/events/monthlymeetings) page.

Our December 8th evening will start with a potluck dinner at 7:30 PM, followed by a social evening. Bring your fossils from your summer field trips! APS members will have specimens on display and resident experts will be on hand to help identify fossils that are brought in.

**Please note that this meeting is on the 2nd Friday of the month rather then the usual 3rd Friday of the month.**
