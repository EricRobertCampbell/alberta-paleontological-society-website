**by Mona Trick**

Aid the research of **Dr. Jessica Theodor** and **Dr. Alex Dutchak** of the University of
Calgary by searching the matrix (soil) from the Cypress Hills Formation (Middle Eocene)
of Saskatchewan to find tiny fossils. We will be using microscopes in **room B140
at Mount Royal University**. Join us from 1:00 until 3:30
pm. on the following Sundays:

-   **January 26, 2025**
-   February 2, 2025
-   March 2, 2025

We are very grateful to Mount Royal University for allowing us to use their microscopes
and lab.

Registration is not required, but if you let Mona Trick (cell: <a href="tel:(587) 578-4579">(587) 578-4579</a> or
<a href="mailto:giftshop@albertapaleo.org">giftshop@albertapaleo.org</a>) know that you are planning to attend, then she can inform
you if we need to cancel this session. No experience is required. Due to the delicate
nature of this work, only those 12 years and older are allowed to search for the
microfossils. Bring tweezers or a small paint brush to pick the tiny fossils from the soil
and a pen to label your finds. All of the fossils found will be used to aid their research.

For more information, see the [events](/events/) page.
