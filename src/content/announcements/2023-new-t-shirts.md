In his own words,

> "The new t-shirt design is meant to celebrate the diversity of Alberta’s prehistory and connections with our neighbouring regions. Flanking the APS logo to the left and right are a _Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai_ from Pipestone Creek and a _Bison latifrons_, the ice-age longhorn buffalo that ranged across North America. Beneath the _Pachyrhinosaurus_ is _Albertonectes vanderveldei_ from the Bearpaw Formation, which is the world’s longest known elasmosaur. Beneath the _Bison_ are a representative rugose coral, brachiopod, and scaphite ammonite. Directly beneath the APS logo are stromatolites, referencing the 1.1-billion-year-old Siyeh Formation fossils found in the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park and Castle Wildland Provincial Park area. Above the _Pachyrhinosaurus_ is a giant lycopod tree like _Lepidodendron_ or _Sigillaria_, representing the _Stigmaria_ site that used to exist in Canyon Creek. _Stigmaria_ is the name assigned to the root fossils of these ancient lycopods. One of less than a handful of _Stigmaria_ sites in Canada, the site in Canyon Creek was apparently wiped out by the 2013 floods. Above the _Bison_ is a _Metasequoia_ tree, the leaves, twigs, and cones of which are common Late Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic fossils in Alberta. Between them is a volcano representing the 110-million-year-old eruption in the Cranbrook, B.C., area that deposited the Crowsnest Volcanics here in Alberta. Blairemorite is a rare volcanic rock known only from the Crowsnest Volcanics site in the Crowsnest Pass and the Lupata Gorge in Mozambique. The volcano is also a tribute to late APS member Phil Benham, who had a passion for climbing volcanoes around the world and passed away earlier this year."
