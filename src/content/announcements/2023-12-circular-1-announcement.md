The planning for the [Paleo 2024 Symposium](/events/symposium) is really ramping up! In particular, we have published [our first circular](/symposium/2024/Paleo2024Circular1MDT.pdf) and are now looking for poster submissions for the symposium. If you have some research related to palaeontology you're interested in sharing, take a look at the [symposium page](/events/symposium) for additional details.

For more information, see the [symposium](/events/symposium) page.
