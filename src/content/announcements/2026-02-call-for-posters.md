Calling all fossil enthusiasts!

Paleo 2026 invites poster submissions for the Paleo 2026 symposium on March 14. Whether you're a professional, a student just starting out, or an amateur with a fascinating find, we want to hear from you. All palaeontological topics are welcome.

Submit your poster by February 15 to posters@albertapaleo.org. Let's make this symposium a showcase of discovery from across our entire community!
