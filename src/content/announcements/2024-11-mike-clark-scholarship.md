Following the late Mike Clark’s wishes, his family, friends and Mount Royal University are raising funds
to create an endowment for the Mike Clark Memorial Scholarship. Once the $30,000 endowment is
raised, then this fund will join the larger Mount Royal University Endowment fund and recapitalize
annually to exist and disburse in perpetuity. Before his death, Mike requested a scholarship award in his
name for a deserving Mount Royal University geology student who excels in field geology. So far over
$13,000. of the required $30,000. has been raised.

Any size of donation makes a difference. To donate, go to the <a href="foundation.mru.ca/mike-clark-memorial-scholarship">Mount Royal University Foundation</a> website.

You can donate using a credit card. Your donation will be quickly acknowledged via e-mail and a link to
download your Canadian tax receipt will be e-mailed to you shortly afterward.

Mount Royal University is matching individual donations (one per donor up to a maximum of $500.) until
December 3, 2024 by selecting &quot;Yes! Please count this toward Giving Day 2024” on the donation page.

Mike Clark was the APS contact at Mount Royal University for many years until he retired. He faithfully
reserved the rooms and equipment and provided the computer log in information we required for
general meetings, microfossil sorting sessions and the symposium talks and workshops. For the annual
APS symposium, he was there at 8 am to set up the tables, chairs and poster stands. He stayed for the
whole day of the symposium, to make sure everything went well. Then he worked with us to put
everything away. Mike Clark was essential to APS activities.

Contributing to this memorial scholarship is one way we can say “Thank you” to Mike Clark for his
valuable assistance over the years.
