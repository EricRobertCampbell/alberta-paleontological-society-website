On Saturday, we'll have an exciting range of speakers from around Canada. There will also be a selection of booths, poster presesentations, and other events for palaeontological enthusiasts of all ages. Best of all, it is completely free to attend!

Our Sunday workshop is especially exciting! Dr. Bamforth and Jackson Sweder of the Philip J. Currie Dinosaur Museum along with Atharva Roy (APS) will be discussing the role of 3D scanning & printing in palaeontology. They will also be demonstrating how to use a 3D printer to create a replica of a fossil. This is a hands-on workshop, so be prepared to get your hands dirty!
