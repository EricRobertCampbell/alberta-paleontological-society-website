   How we handle the information we gather when you visit our website
 </h3>

 <h2>Alberta Palaeontological Society Privacy Statement</h2>
 <p>
   The APS is committed to respecting the personal privacy of individuals
   who visit our web site. This page summarizes the privacy policy and
   practices of the APS web site.
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>
     APS does not automatically gather any personal information from you,
     such as your name, phone number, e-mail or street address during your
     visit to its web sites. This information is obtained only if you
    supply it voluntarily, usually through contacting us via e-mail or
     registering in a secure portion of the site.
  </li>
   <li>
     Any personal information that you do provide is protected under the
     federal&nbsp;
     <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-privacy-act/">
       <em>Privacy Act</em>
     </a>
     .
   </li>
 </ul>

 <h4>Web server activity logs</h4>

 <p>
   Like most web servers on the Internet, our servers collect and store all
   of the information that your web browser sends when it requests a web
   page.
 </p>

 <p>
   It is impossible to determine the actual identity of an individual user
   from this information.
 </p>

 <p>
   The logs are periodically summarized and analyzed in order to study site
   usage over time and to perform other studies to help us improve the
   site's organization, performance, and usefulness.
 </p>

 <h4>Electronic mail</h4>
 <p>
   When you send us personal identifying information via e-mail (that is,
   in a message containing a question or comment, or by filling out a form
   that e-mails us this information), we use it to respond to your
   requests. We do not retain or distribute lists of e-mail addresses to
   any parties outside of APS.
 </p>

 <h4>File transfer protocol (FTP)</h4>
 <p>
   Our site using the file transfer protocol may also store your e-mail
   address if your web browser is configured to provide it. By default most
   web browser software does not send your e-mail address; this option is
   configured through your browser preferences. In Netscape Navigator, for
   example, this option must be set by you through the Advanced preferences
   category by the item labeled, "Send email address as anonymous FTP
   password."
 </p>

 <h4>Collection and release of gathered information </h4>
 <p>
   We want to make it clear that we will not obtain personal identifying
   information about you when you visit our web site. Except in the course
   of officially authorized law enforcement investigations, or in the event
   of a suspected attempt to deliberately circumvent our system's security
   with the intent to gain unauthorized access or to do physical damage
   (for example, an attack by hackers), we do not attempt to identify
   individual users or share any information we receive with any parties
   outside of the APS. In the latter case, collected information associated
   with a suspected intruder might be shared with law enforcement.
 </p>

 <h4>Retention of collected information </h4>
 <p>
   <b>Cookies</b> - Some applications may save a "cookie" on your
   computer's hard disk to provide a temporary history of actions taken. A
   common example is the tracking of items placed in an online "shopping
   basket." We do not retain any record of "cookies" beyond what is
   necessary for running the application.
 </p>
 <p>
   <b>Web server activity logs</b> - Monthly extracts of the log files are
   archived and stored off-line at our discretion for an indefinite period
   of time. Some statistical summaries derived from these data may be
   retained online or off-line at our discretion for an indefinite period
   of time.
 </p>

 <p>
   <b>E-mail</b> - Information collected via e-mail will be retained at our
   discretion in a directly readable form for as long as necessary to
   complete our response. The e-mail itself may be retained in an archival
   form.
 </p>
