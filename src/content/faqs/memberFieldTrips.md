question: I'm not a member, can I attend a field trip?
order: 2

You have to be a member to attend field trips. By joining the society
you will be entitled to enjoy all the other benefits of membership too.
To join the society visit the MEMBERSHIP tab on this website. If you
plan to join the society, join several weeks before the field trip
rather then on the day of the field trip. The field trip coordinator is
busy organizing the trip and does not handle memberships at the site.
