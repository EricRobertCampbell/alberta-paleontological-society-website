<p>
  Visit the <a href="/events/monthlymeetings">Monthly Meetings</a> tab on this website.
  Once in that section of the website, scroll to the bottom where you
  will find a map of Mount Royal University in Calgary including the
  parking areas. The University does charge a small fee for parking.

  A map of the parking areas can also be found on the last page of the <a href="/members/membersguide">Members' Guide</a>.
