question: How does a person become a palaeontologist?
order: 1

<p>
  Not many universities offer 4-year undergraduate degrees in
  palaeontology. The ones that do are mostly in the USA, such as UC
  Berkeley (California). The usual route to becoming a palaeontologist
  is to begin with getting a Bachelor's degree in one of two fields of
  science: geology or biology. Which one you choose will very much
  depend on your interests. Even after choosing say the geology path, it
  is still a good idea to also take courses in the biology field,
  especially zoology and anatomy.

  Each school has different course requirements for a degree program.
  You will likely have to take courses in math, physics, chemistry as
  well as options from other faculties (English, foreign languages,
  social sciences, history, arts, etc.) as a requirement for completing
  your degree. These latter courses may seem like a waste of time, but
  they are requirements for getting a degree, and you will have to take
  them. A course in English and creative writing is important too
  because to be a good palaeontologist, you will have to be able to
  write papers and you MUST be able to communicate properly. Mathematics
  is important because study of fossils often includes statistical
  analysis.

  If you're still in high school, make sure you take biology, physics,
  chemistry and math before you graduate from grade 12. If you're
  missing any of these you will run into roadblocks in university. Once
  you have your 4-year degree in geology or biology, then you will be
  able to specialize in palaeontology in a Master's program (usually
  another 2 years), and continue with a PhD program (another 2 to 5
  years--some very bright people skip the Master's degree and go
  straight to the PhD). You will find that you need a PhD in order to
  teach or do research in palaeontology. The best way to find out which
  specific courses you need is to talk to the people in the departments
  you are interested in. If you want to go to U of A, go to the
  department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences (geology), or Biological
  Sciences, and ask to talk to someone (a counsellor or one of the
  professors) about course requirements for a career in palaeontology.
  They will ask you the right questions and give you the best
  information. Same for any other university (such as U of Calgary) you
  might be interested in attending. (Yes, you can get a palaeontology
  degree at U of C &mdash; there are several graduate students studying
  dinosaurs there right now.)
