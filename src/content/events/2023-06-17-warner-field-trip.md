Leader: Mona Trick

Mona will lead us to the famous Devil’s Coulee dinosaur egg-site in southern Alberta. In the morning, we will enjoy a guided tour of the Devil’s Coulee Dinosaur Heritage Museum (located in Warner, Alberta). In the afternoon, we will have an extended tour of where dinosaur eggs were first discovered in Canada. We will also have time to search for Late Cretaceous (Campanian) fossils (such as dinosaur eggshell) but we will not be able to keep anything we find, as this is a protected site. The price includes admission to the museum and the guided tour of the eggsite. Due to the restricted amount of parking at the egg-site we will car pool the 30 minutes from the museum to the egg-site. This field trip is just one day in length and Warner is about a 3-hour drive from Calgary. Registration is limited to 40 people. For additional details, including camping and motel information, contact Mona Trick at giftshop@albertapaleo.org or (587) 578-4579.

**Registration deadline is June 1, 2023.**
