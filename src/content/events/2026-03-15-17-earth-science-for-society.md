## Who We Are

The Canadian Society of Exploration Geophysicists (CSEG) Foundation is excited to be organizing the Earth Science for Society (ESfS) exhibition in Calgary Alberta. The ESfS organizing committee members are geoscience volunteers.

## What We Do

This is a free, family-friendly event with activities for all ages. You are invited to visit our four themed pavilions Energy for Us, Resources and You, One Dynamic Earth and Our Future! ESfS showcases hands-on, interactive exhibits showing the importance of the Earth Sciences in our everyday lives in a fun way. Geoscience volunteers are on hand to help you and the youth groups, elementary and junior high school students who attend on organized visits.

## ESfS Vision

The Earth Science for Society exhibition will inspire an understanding of Earth Science which is fundamental to public appreciation of responsible consumption, resource management, natural hazards, climate science, and environmental issues.

Knowledge of Earth Science is crucial for responsible collaboration by geoscientists, governments, and companies to find and develop resources for the products and infrastructure that we use in our daily lives.

Increased science literacy is essential for the students of today as they are the decision-makers of tomorrow and the future caretakers of the Earth.
