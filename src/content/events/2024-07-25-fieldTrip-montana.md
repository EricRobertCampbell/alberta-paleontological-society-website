The Upper Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation in Montana is world-famous for its cache of iconic dinosaur remains such as _Tyrannosaurus rex_, _Nanotyrannus_ and _Triceratops_. However, gaining access to sites to hunt for vertebrate fossils in the “Treasure State” are extremely limited. Through its contacts, the APS has secured access to a private ranch within rich Hell Creek fossil beds south of Jordan, Montana. Jason Phipps, the older brother of Clayton Phipps (from the TV Show Dino Hunters), has recently been allowing groups to collect on his land for a fee. We expect to excavate at an extremely rich microvertebrate fossil site on the ranch that regularly yields theropod, herbivore and mammal teeth. We will be allowed to keep what we collect—with the exception of very valuable fossils (Jason uses these funds to supplement his family income on his small cattle ranch). We are hoping to add an additional site (possibly an invertebrate locality) and/or a facility tour (such as a museum or preparation lab) to this trip. Again, watch the Bulletin for updates.

**Proposed Itinerary**

- Thursday, July 25: Travel to Jordan, MT.
- Friday, July 26 and Saturday, July 27: Caravan (40 minutes) each day to and from Jason Phipps Ranch; Expect long, hot days with lunch in the field with no facilities.
- Sunday, July 28: TBD: Explore nearby Bearpaw Formation invertebrate sites and/or museum tour.
- Monday, July 29: Return to Calgary.

Jordan is a 9-hour drive from Calgary (excluding the time required to cross the USA-Canada border, which can be quite variable). Participants will have to find their own way to and from Jordan. NOTE! There are very limited basic accommodations in Jordan (Garfield Motel, K&K RV Park, Old Dorm RV Park and Motel 200) with camping likely the best option (Contact Keith for more information). Participants will have to make their own sleeping and travel arrangements to and from Jordan. The fee for collecting on Jason’s ranch is us$125 cash per person, PER DAY (total US $250 for two days—payable to Jason directly on July 26). There may be additional fees so watch for updates in future issues of the Bulletin. There are no restrictions for attendance but motel space could be a limiting factor.
