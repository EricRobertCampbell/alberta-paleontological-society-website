**NOTE: This field trip is now full.**

Leader: Steve Kary

Palaeontologist Steve Kary will lead us to several interesting Upper Cretaceous sites along the Red Deer River valley near Dorothy, Alberta. Steve has been doing active research in this area for the past few seasons. He has a number of sites for us to visit, possibly including a lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation dinosaur bonebed (slumped into two separate outcrops); an invertebrate site; _Ophiomorpha_ ichnofossils; and rippled sandstone beds. Expect to hike in rugged badlands terrain with long slopes heading in and out of the main valley. There is a fee of $40 per member for this trip to help offset expected costs. Further, due to restricted private access, we can only accommodate 20 members so if you are interested please register early to avoid disappointment. This field trip is just one day in length and Dorothy is about a 2-hour drive east of Calgary. More details to follow.
