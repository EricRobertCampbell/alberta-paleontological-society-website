This will be the final trip I organize for APS and
it will help fulfil a childhood dream. My mother is from Montana and, as a child, I often studied
road maps on many of our family trips back to her home state. On the official highway map of Montana,
I saw a "point of interest" labelled "Grasshopper
Glacier." I subsequently learned that a swarm of
Rocky Mountain Locust (_Melanoplus spretus_), a now
extinct species, had become entombed in glacial ice
at this spot sometime in the distant past. The glacier
is located near the highest peaks in North America.
Nearby Granite Peak is 3903 m (12,807 ft) in elevation! For decades, I had assumed the site was only
heli-accessible but have since discovered the journey
to and from the glacier may be made in a day. We are
enlisting professional help from Beartooth Mountain Guides to lead us to our goal.

Using rented UTVs, we will depart Cooke City,
MT and traverse approximately 10 miles of "road" to
near Goose Lake, just within the Beartooth-Absaroka
Wilderness boundary. From the lake, we will have to
hike the remaining 3.5 miles, with an elevation gain
of about 400 m (1300 ft). The hike is not particularly
challenging but participants should expect off-trail
travel over boulders and exposure to wind, sun
and quick weather changes due to the high elevation (over 3000 m or 10,000 ft), all in bear country! Afternoon thunderstorms or even flurries are
possible. The hike is extremely scenic and will take
about 6 to 7-hours, round-trip. We hope to spend a
minimum of one hour at the glacier before making
the long journey back to Cooke City. The glacier has
shrunk dramatically over the past 100 years and we
may discover there are no remaining grasshoppers to
observe within the ice. We will also visit an aban-
doned copper mine along the same route and learn
about the unique geology of the region. This trek is
only recommended for those in good physical condition and, preferably, with backcountry experience.
Note this portion of the trip will include a professional guide fee (us$200 per person) as well as a portion of the UTV rental (approx. us$75 per person);
details are to follow.

Part two of our Montana journey will be much
easier! Adjacent to scenic Beartooth Lake (about
45 minutes from Cooke City) lies a rare Devonian
fish and shark fossil site. A red patch in the mid-
dle of Beartooth Butte is deposits from an ancient
channel system, similar to Alberta’s Yahatinda
Formation. Conveniently, there is a nice US Forest
Service campground at the lake and about an hour’s
hike from here will get us to the locality. The site is
located on a steep slope, which is exposed to quick
weather changes. Although much shorter than the
Grasshopper Glacier journey, I recommend you have
hiking experience in the mountains before participating. However, the drive between Cooke City and
Red Lodge, Montana is absolutely breathtaking and
is well worth the trip on its own! It is easily comparable to, if not better than, the Going-to-the-Sun
Highway in Glacier National Park. There are plenty
of tourist accommodations in Cooke City and Red
Lodge and many campgrounds—but expect cool to
cold nights, even in August.

Note that both localities are protected sites (no
collecting allowed), although we hope to photodocument fossils you are unlikely to see anywhere
else. Many more details are to follow. If you sign up for this trip, please
indicate if you wish to participate in one or both
parts of this trip. I recommend taking 2-days to drive
from Alberta to Cooke City (be warned that Google
Maps will provide you with inaccurate routes until
the Beartooth Highway re-opens in the spring—otherwise you will encounter some very bad advice!)
