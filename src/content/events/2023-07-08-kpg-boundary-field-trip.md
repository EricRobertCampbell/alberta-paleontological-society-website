Leader: Tako Koning

If you missed this tour last year, Tako will again lead us to the famous Cretaceous-Paleocene boundary (formerly the “K/T boundary”) site on Knudsen’s farm near Huxley, AB. This site is the best location in Canada to view the K/Pg mass extinction boundary. It marks the event when dinosaurs and 75 percent of the Earth’s creatures and plants died almost instantaneously. Extensive academic research at this site has contributed materially to our knowledge of what happened to the world at that time. Huxley is about a 2-hour drive from Calgary. This is a single-day trip.

**Registration deadline is July 1, 2023.**
