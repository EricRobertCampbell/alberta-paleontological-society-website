Search for tiny fossils to aid the research of **Dr. Jessica Theodor** and **Dr. Alex Dutchak**
of the University of Calgary. Join us as we use microscopes to search the matrix (soil)
from the Cypress Hills Formation (Middle Eocene, about 50 million years old) of
Saskatchewan to find teeth, scales, skull elements and other fossils from mammals,
reptiles and amphibians. We will be using microscopes in room B140 in the Main
Building of Mount Royal University from 1:00 until 3:30 pm. on the following Sundays:

- **March 2, 2025**

Registration is not required, but if you let Mona Trick (cell: <a href="tel:(587) 578-4579">(587) 578-4579</a> or
<a href="mailto:giftshop@albertapaleo.org">giftshop@albertapaleo.org</a>) know that you are planning to attend, then she can inform
you if we need to cancel this session. No experience is required. Due to the delicate
nature of this work, only those 12 years and older are allowed to participate. Bring
tweezers (with pointed ends) or a small paint brush to pick the tiny fossils from the soil
and a pen to label your finds. All of the fossils found will be turned over to **Dr. Jessica
Theodor** and **Dr. Alex Dutchak** for their research. We want to thank Mount Royal
University for allowing us to use their microscopes and lab.
