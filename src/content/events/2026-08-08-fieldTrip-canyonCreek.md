This one-day trip within an easy drive of Calgary is perfect for people who are just getting started with fossil collecting! The Canyon Creek trail / Moose Mountain area preserves many different kinds of sea creatures from the Carboniferous (about 350 Ma) and Jurassic (about 150 Ma), including brachiopods, bryozoans, and ammonites.

This trip will feature a short hike along a gravel road, with stops to visit some fossil collecting spots and areas of geological and palaeontological interest along the way. We'll discuss what the fossils we find can tell us about how the Rockies were formed and what that means about the history of the Earth! If you're just getting started fossil collecting or have children interested in palaeontology, this is the trip for you.

**Price:** $10

**Registration deadline: August 1, 2026.**
