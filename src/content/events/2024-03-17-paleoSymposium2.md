In conjunction with Mount Royal University Earth and Environmental
Sciences and the CEGA Paleontology Division, we are pleased to announce
that the 27<sup>th</sup> annual Alberta Paleontological Society Symposium
will take place on Saturday, March 16, 2024 with workshops on Sunday, March 17.

This symposium will contain presentations from a mix of amateur and
professional palaeontologists. The aim is to showcase palaeontology to
the general public and to provide an opportunity for contact between the
Alberta Palaeontological Society, industry, government and educational
facilities. The event is free and all are welcome to attend or join
virtually. Families are encouraged to bring fossils to our
identification booth where APS members will do their best to provide you
with information.

See the [symposium page](/events/symposium) for additional details.
