**Leader: Tako Koning**

If you missed this tour previously, Tako will again
lead us to the famous Cretaceous-Paleocene
boundary (formerly the "K/T boundary") site on
Knudsen’s farm near Huxley, AB. This boundary
marks the end of the dinosaurs and this particular
site has contributed materially to our knowledge of
what happened to the world at that time. Huxley is
about a 2-hour drive from Calgary. This is a single-
day trip. The fee is $10.

To register for this and any other trips, download and complete [the field trip permission form](/fieldTrips/2025/APSFieldTripsForm2025.pdf).

**Registration deadline is July 1.**
