**Leader: Tako Koning**

A perennial favourite and staple of the APS field trip program, Tako will again lead us to the famous Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (formerly the "K/T boundary") site on Knudsen's farm near Huxley, AB. This boundary marks the abrupt end of the age of dinosaurs and this particular site has contributed materially to our knowledge of what happened to the world at that time. Huxley is about a 2-hour drive from Calgary. This is a single-day trip and is family-friendly.

**Price:** $10

**Registration deadline: July 1, 2026.**
