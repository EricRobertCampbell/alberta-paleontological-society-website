Explore the mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs, and find out how these ancient beasts adapted as North America's climate changed from tropical to an ice age. Using real fossils from our Collection, you will see some familiar favourites such as the mammoth and sabre-toothed cat, and also meet some unique mega-mammals like the giant ground sloth and Glyptodont. We'll find out that not all giants were dinosaurs!
