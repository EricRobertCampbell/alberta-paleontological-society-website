We wil be searching for and sorting micro fossils from matrix again this fall and winter.

In November and December, we will be sorting matrix for Dr. Jessica Theodor and Dr. Alex Dutchak from the University of Calgary. All of the fossils we find will be used to aid research into the Eocene of Saskatchewan. The matrix comes from the Cypress Hills Formation (Middle Eocene) and provides important insight into the northern fauna of this period.

All sessions will take place in room B213. There is a map available on line at the Mount Royal University website and showing parking available. The organizer for this year's fossil sorting workshop is Mona Trick.
No fee for this event. It is open to the public and it is a good family event.

Registration is not required, but if you contact me, Mona Trick, (587) 578-4579 or email giftshop@albertapaleo.org, and let me know if you are planning to attend, then Iâ€™ll be able to inform you in case we need to cancel a session. No experience is required. Bring tweezers to pick the tiny fossils from the soil and a pen to label your finds.
