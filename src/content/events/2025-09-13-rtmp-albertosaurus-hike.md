Join Royal Tyrrell Museum palaeontologist Dr. Francois Therrien and two science educators on a guided hike to the Albertosaurus bonebed in Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park, Alberta. Learn about the fossil site where the remains of at least 12 Albertosaurus dinosaurs were discovered buried together, forming the scientific basis for one of the Royal Tyrrell Museum's most popular exhibits, the Cretaceous Alberta diorama.
