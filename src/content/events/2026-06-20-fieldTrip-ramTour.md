Check out the excellent palaeontology exhibits at the Royal Alberta Museum in Edmonton. Dr. Chris Jass will be leading special tours of the Royal Alberta Museum collection, laboratory and gallery areas for us. Tours begin at 12:45 pm, but you can arrive earlier (museum is open 10 am to 4 pm) if you would like to view the other areas of the museum first.

We will book as a group to take advantage of discounted group admission.

While not part of this trip proper, there's an option to go to the [Jurassic Forest](https://www.jurassicforest.com) (780) 470-2446 located near Gibbons, Alberta to view the animatronic dinosaurs arranged along the hiking trails.
