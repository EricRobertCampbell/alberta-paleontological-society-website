Winter blues? You can still find fossils in the dark depths of winter at the APS microfossil sorting sessions on the following Sunday afternoons:

-   January 14, 2024
-   January 28, 2024
-   February 11, 2024
-   February 25, 2024
-   **March 10, 2024**

We will be using microscopes in room B213 at Mount Royal University (Main Building)
from 1:00 until 3:30 pm. We will be aiding the research of Dr. Jessica Theodor and Dr.
Alex Dutchak of the University of Calgary by finding tiny fossils in the matrix (soil)
from the Cypress Hills Formation (Middle Eocene) of Saskatchewan. APS is very
grateful to Mount Royal University for allowing us to use their microscopes and lab.
Registration is not required, but if you let Mona Trick (tel. <a href="tel:(587) 578-4579">(587) 578-4579</a> or
<a href="mailto:giftshop@albertapaleo.org">giftshop@albertapaleo.org</a>) know that you are planning to attend, then she can inform
you if we need to cancel this session. No experience is required. Bring tweezers (with
pointed ends) or a small paint brush to pick the tiny fossils from the soil and a pen to
label your finds. Parking is free at Mount Royal University on Sundays.
