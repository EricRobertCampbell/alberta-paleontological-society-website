Leader: Tako Koning

If you missed this tour previously, Tako will again lead us to the famous Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (formerly the “K/T boundary”) site on Knudsen’s farm near Huxley, AB. This boundary marks the end of the dinosaurs and this particular site has contributed materially to our knowledge of what happened to the world at that time. Huxley is about a 2-hour drive from Calgary. This is a single-day trip with fee of $10.
