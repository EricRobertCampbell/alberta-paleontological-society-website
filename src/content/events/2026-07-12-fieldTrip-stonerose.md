**Leader: Georgia Hoffman**

Palaeobotanist and APS member Georgia Hoffman will lead our first expedition to Washington State. We will gather in Republic, WA to tour the Stonerose Interpretive Center & Eocene Fossil Site ([www.stonerosefossil.org](https://www.stonerosefossil.org)). The locality entombs an Eocene (49 million year old) fossil ecosystem that includes flora and insects (other animal remains are very rare) that were buried under volcanic ash and sediments within an ancient lake. Along with an interpretive centre tour, we will be able to excavate the shale beds and search for our own fossils! This is a family-friendly venue and should be a great educational experience. Republic is about a 9-hour drive from Calgary.

In addition to the APS fee, participants will also need to pay a small fee to access the Stonerose Centre (approximately: Senior 62+ US$12; Adult 18-61 US$18; Youth 5-17 US$7; Under 5 free).

**Price:** $10 + Stonerose Centre fee

**Registration deadline: July 1, 2026.**
