We have been planning this trip for a number of years and finally it is here! The Green River Formation is world-famous for fossil fish, rays, palm leaves and even prehistoric horses and birds preserved in stunning detail in Eocene lake sediments. This trip will take place over 3 days – excluding the long drive to and from Wyoming – in order to accommodate everything we hope to see and do. Kemmerer, Wyoming is a 13.5 hour drive from Calgary (excluding the time required to cross the USA-Canada border; which can be quite variable. Participants will have to find their own way to and from Kemmerer and I strongly recommend splitting-up the drive over (at least) two days in each direction.

Please view the videos on Warfield’s website www.fossilsafari.com to give you an idea of what to expect. Most exciting is the opportunity to watch the professionals excavate fossils at nighttime from the famous “18 Inch Layer” during their “V.I.P dig”. Artificial illumination helps the pros spot subtle clues in the rock indicating where fossils are located. Then they excavate with special shims, chisels and rock saws. It should be quite the learning experience. For those willing to pay an optional fee, you will be able to keep one fossil fish recovered during the night dig. I understand these are quite remarkable; however, the nighttime experience is optional whether you are paying or simply observing.

Please register early and ONLY if you are serious about attending. Expect hot weather! There are no restrictions for attendance but motel space could be a limiting factor.

**Registration deadline is June 15, 2023.**
