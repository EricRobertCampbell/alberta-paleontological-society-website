This meeting will include our annual AGM.

Main Talk: **Dr. Leslie Eliuk**, GeoTours Consulting Inc. – **"Reefs by the Roadside – a preliminary guide to easily accessible (by viewing or walking) Canadian fossil reef localities"** [Abstract & Bio](/presentationAbstracts/2026/Leslie-Eliuk_APS_abstract-May-8-2026-Reefs-by-the-Roadside.pdf)

Canada is blessed with many fossil reefs; a fair number are close enough to roads to be easily walked to or viewed. This talk expands on Dr. Eliuk’s recently published *Reefs by the Roadside* (APS Bulletin 2025-03, edited by Howard Allen). After an overview of fossil reefs through time, a trip across Canada visits fossil reef examples—including the Devonian Nisku beds at Grassi Lakes, the Leduc reef margin at the Big Hill on the Jasper–Banff highway, the Ediacaran Yellowhead carbonate platform near Mt. Robson, the “petrified beaver dam reef” (travertines/tufas) at Big Hill Springs Park, and Cambrian and Carboniferous reefs in Labrador, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia—with illustrated examples and a list of potential sites. The main source of data is the Canadian Reef Inventory Project (CRIP) and related work (e.g. CSPG Memoir 13). This is a work in progress; contributions of other examples or ground truthing are welcome (leslie.eliuk@gmail.com or APS).
