**Date**: Friday, November 22 - Saturday, November 23

This is a fantastic event for kids & families, but we require at least one adult per five children. Please note also that only children between **5 - 13 years old** and their adults are eligible to attend.

**Space is limited** — we’re only accepting the first 20 registrants, so don’t delay!

This program often fills up quickly, so the deadline for registration is **October 21**!

**Additional Information**: Visit [Royal Tyrrell Museum Camp-Ins](https://www.tyrrellmuseum.com/whats_on/activities/camp-ins) for more details.

This is a rare opportunity during the winter months when palaeontology events are usually scarce, so invite friends and family who share your interest in ancient life. Even if they’re not yet APS members, this could be the perfect introduction!
