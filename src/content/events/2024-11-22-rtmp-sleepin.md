The Alberta Palaeontological Society is excited to invite you to a special overnight event at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta!

**Date**: Friday, November 22 - Saturday, November 23

**Itinerary**:

-   Friday Evening:
    -   6:30 PM: Arrive at the museum
    -   Participate in fun palaeontology activities
    -   Enjoy snacks
    -   Lights out for the night

**Price**: $51 per person

Your ticket includes:

-   Full-day admission to the museum

This is a fantastic event for kids & families, but we require at least one adult per five children. Please note also that only children between **5 - 13 years old** and their adults are eligible to attend.

**Space is limited** — we’re only accepting the first 20 registrants, so don’t delay!

This program often fills up quickly, so the deadline for registration is **October 1**!

**Additional Information**: Visit [Royal Tyrrell Museum Camp-Ins](https://www.tyrrellmuseum.com/whats_on/activities/camp-ins) for more details.

This is a rare opportunity during the winter months when palaeontology events are usually scarce, so invite friends and family who share your interest in ancient life. Even if they’re not yet APS members, this could be the perfect introduction!

To sign up, use [this form](</fieldTrips/2024/rtmp-sleepin/RTMP - Field Trip Sign Up.pdf>) or see the [field trip page](https://albertapaleo.org/events/fieldtrips) on the APS website.
