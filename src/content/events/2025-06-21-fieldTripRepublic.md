**Leader: Georgia Hoffman**

Our own Georgia Hoffman, a palaeobotanist,
is volunteering to lead our first expedition to
Washington State. We will gather in Republic, WA
to tour the Stonerose Interpretive Center & Eocene
Fossil Site (see www.stonerosefossil.org). The locality entombs an Eocene (49 million year old) fossil ecosystem including flora, fauna and insects that
were buried under volcanic ash and sediments within
an ancient lake. Along with an interpretive centre
tour, we will be able to excavate the shale beds and
search for our own fossils! This is a family-friendly
venue and should be a great educational experience.
Republic is about a 9-hour drive from Calgary. Note
the date is subject to change as details are still pending. The fee is $10, plus a fee payable to Stonerose
(around $18 USD).

To register for this and any other trips, download and complete [the field trip permission form](/fieldTrips/2025/APSFieldTripsForm2025.pdf).

**Registration deadline is May 30.**
