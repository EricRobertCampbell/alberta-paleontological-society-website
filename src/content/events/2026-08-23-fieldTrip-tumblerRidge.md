This trip will take place on the Sunday and Monday after the trip to the Pipestone Creek Bonebed and is just a short 2-hour drive away!

Tumbler Ridge is a small town with a host of palaeontological treasures. Although probably best known for its preserved Ankylosaur tracks, the area around the town also contains some Cretaceous bone sites, additional tracksites, and fossils ranging in age from the early Palaeozoic right to the more recent ice ages.

We'll be exploring the treasures this town has over the course of 2 days. On Sunday, we'll take a guided tour of the Tumbler Ridge museum and then switch over to visit the Flatbed Cabin Pool tracksite. On Monday, we'll go on a full-day hike to visit one of the lesser-known Triassic fish sites, where we hope to make some discoveries of our own!

As Monday's trip will be a strenuous 8-hour day (hiking along with fossil collecting) it may not be suitable for everyone. As a result, you can choose to attend only Sunday's events ($30) or go on both days ($55).

**Price:** $30 (Sunday only) or $55 (Sunday & Monday)

**Registration deadline: August 1, 2026.**
