Our gracious host, Eva Koppelhus of the University of Alberta, will guide us to a hadrosaur bone-bed located within the city limits of Edmonton. The Danek Bone-bed is used to teach students enrolled at the paleontology program at the University of Alberta as their field school. Eva has also arranged for us to have a backrooms tour of their paleo-lab so we can better appreciate how fossils are prepared and studied. Normally closed on weekends, we will also be provided special access to the University of Alberta Paleontology Museum, which houses the universityâ€™s fossil collection. Participants may also wish to tour the Royal Alberta Museum across town on their own schedule. Due to limited physical space at both the bone-bed and the lab, registration is limited to 20 participants. This is a single-day field trip.

**Registration deadline is August 1, 2023.**
