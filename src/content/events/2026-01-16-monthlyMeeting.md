**Title:** First report of Paleocene amber from Estevan, Canada—geochemistry and inclusions

**Abstract**

Amber's chemical structure has allowed for the excellent preservation of both primary isotope signatures and fossil arthropods. Amber deposits are poorly represented during the latest Cretaceous and throughout the Paleocene. This lack of data hinders our understanding of how insects and other terrestrial organisms with low preservation potential performed across the end-Cretaceous extinction event. Here we present a newly discovered amber deposit in the Estevan coalbeds (Ravenscrag Formation, Paleocene, ~62 Ma) of Southern Saskatchewan. This new deposit helps fill in the Cretaceous−Paleogene Amber Bioinclusions Gap (72.1–55 Ma). Four coal seams are found at the site, three are amber producing, and currently only one has produced amber with bioinclusions. Several botanical and arthropod inclusions found represent some of the earliest Paleocene insects in amber, demonstrating the potential to uncover important evolutionary information for this time with additional collection and preparation. The deposit is also characterized using stable isotopes of carbon and hydrogen (δ13C and δD), and Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. δ13C values suggest the amber producing tree was stressed. δD values from amber indicate a significant coastal influence during the Early Paleocene, likely recording the receding Western Interior Seaway. FTIR results allow chemical comparisons to modern resins and indicate the resin source to be Cupressaceae conifers. This multi-proxy approach of ecosystem reconstruction provides a vital window into arthropod recovery after the K–Pg extinction event and the conditions they persisted in. Future work will examine an additional (~64 Ma) section in Southern Saskatchewan, near the K–Pg boundary, to investigate wider ecological changes during this time.

**Biography**

Katie is in her final year of undergraduate studies at the University of Regina, pursuing a B.Sc. Hons. majoring in Geology. She has been an NSERC student researcher in the Department of Earth Science since 2023, researching a variety of topics, including amber isotopes and inclusions in southern Saskatchewan. This project, which has expanded into her undergrad thesis, is supervised by Dr. Ryan McKellar, Dr. Maria Velez, and Dr. Leslie Robbins at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum and University of Regina. Katie hopes to continue combining geochemistry and paleontology by pursuing an M.Sc. in Geology in the Fall of 2026.

**Title:** First Impressions are important! From dragonflies to beetles, new insect impression fossils from the Dinosaur Park Formation provide invaluable insight into Cretaceous life.

**Abstract**

Impression fossils can preserve large insect fossils not commonly found in amber inclusions, and as such are incredibly valuable when reconstructing paleoecosystems. Unfortunately, aside from the occasional discovery from the Cretaceous Wapiti formation, few Mesozoic insect impression fossils have been researched in Alberta. This all changed during the 2022-2024 field expeditions to Dinosaur Provincial Park led by a crew from McGill University. While a newfound plant locality was being quarried for its well-preserved leaf impressions, several unexpected discoveries were made, including an exquisitely preserved partial hindwing of a dragonfly. While small, this hindwing, attributable to the subclade Cavilabiata (which includes many of the dragonfly species that inhabit Alberta today), possessed unique anatomy that merited its description as a brand new species, Cordualadensa acorni. This dragonfly marks the first known dinosaur-aged dragonfly from all of Canada and helps fill in a notable 30 million year gap in the global fossil record of the Cavilabiata. Following the discovery that insect fossils can be preserved in Dinosaur Park, several more insect impression fossils have been discovered, opening an exciting untapped frontier of paleontological discoveries in Alberta.

**Biography**

Born in Calgary and raised in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Andre Mueller has always been passionate about prehistoric life, especially the underappreciated areas of paleontology. Currently a Master's student studying at McGill University in Montreal, he regularly conducts fieldwork in Dinosaur Provincial Park and the surrounding area. Much of his research focuses on Cretaceous plant and insect fossils from across Canada, such as the Redmond Formation of Labrador and the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta. Andre has made several paleoentomological discoveries, including the description of Canada's first dinosaur-aged dragonfly, Cordualadensa acorni, and the description of three new mayfly species from Labrador.

**Title:** Describing a new species of Staphylinid beetle from Dominican amber

**Abstract**

As a preservation medium, ambers can exquisitely record faunal and botanical inclusions typically lost in the fossil record. In our study we report the first fossil members of Alloraphes from Dominican amber, extending the genus' range to the Miocene and confirming their presence on Caribbean Island of Hispaniola. Using CT-scan data from the Canadian Light Source we were able to create three dimensional models to accurately describe the new species. These small (< 1 mm) staphylinid beetles inhabit leaf litter and would typically have been lost in the fossil record if it were not for amber. Given the remarkable evolutionary status that Dominican insect genera demonstrate it is possible the genus is still present on the island today awaiting discovery.

**Biography**

Ben Egan is a PhD candidate at the University of Regina currently applying non-traditional isotope systems to fossil material. Growing up in England, Ben studied for his undergraduate degree at Durham University where he was given the option to intern at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum describing insect inclusions in amber. After this experience, Ben decided to return to Canada for graduate studies.
