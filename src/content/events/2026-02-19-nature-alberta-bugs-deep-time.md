Insects are the most diverse animals on Earth. More than half of all named species are insects, exceeding the combined total of plants and vertebrate animals. This extraordinary diversification began over 500 million years ago, long before most other animals colonized land, and it continues today.

In this talk, we will explore a unique window into the deep past: Alberta's insect fossil record from approximately 60 million years ago, after the extinction of the dinosaurs. These fossils reveal a very different insect community from the one we see today and help us understand how modern ecosystems came to be. Fossils are not just remnants of extinct life, they are an essential extension of the living world, connecting past biodiversity to the present. Studying them allows us to better understand evolution, climate change, and the history of life on Earth.
