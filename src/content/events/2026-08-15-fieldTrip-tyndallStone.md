**Leader: Tako Koning**

Once again, Tako Koning has agreed to conduct his popular tour of Calgary structures adorned in Ordovician-aged Red River Formation limestone originally quarried in Tyndall, Manitoba. See impressively preserved fossils of corals, gastropods, orthocone nautiloids, receptaculitids, and the trace fossil thalassinoides (fossilized burrows) at sites around Kensington and the SAIT campus. This opportunity to go fossil hunting right in the city is suitable for all ages.

The field trip commences in Kensington at 1:00 PM and is complete by 4:30 PM.

**Price:** $10

**Registration deadline: August 1, 2026.**
