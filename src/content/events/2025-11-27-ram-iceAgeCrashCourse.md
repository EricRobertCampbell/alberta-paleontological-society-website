How do you know the difference between a Mastodon and a Mammoth tooth? How about a Bison's foot from a Horse's? These skills and many more are key for palaeontologists as they piece together Alberta's frozen past.

In this workshop, our Quaternary Paleontology Team will teach you basic comparative anatomy of Ice Age fossils, and how you can examine a skeleton to identify an animal group or species.
