The Alberta Palaeontological Society welcomes CSPG (CEGA) members, families and the general public to the December Christmas Social and Open House.

The evening will start with a potluck dinner at 7:30 PM followed by a social evening. Bring your fossils from your summer field trips! APS members will have specimens on display and resident experts will be on hand to help identify fossils that are brought in.

**Please note that this meeting is on the 2nd Friday of the month rather then the usual 3rd Friday of the month.**
