**Leaders: Les Wingerter & Keith Mychaluk**

APS member Les Wingerter will guide our group
to a well-known dinosaur bone-bed eroding
along the shores of a local reservoir. For a few of
us "old members," this will be a fun follow-up to a
1990s APS trip to the same locality. The site remains
productive with the winds of southern Alberta constantly whipping up erosional waves and exposing
new glimpses to the past. A 45-minute drive from
the reservoir to a nearby dam will give our group an
opportunity to explore a boulder field with scattered
dinosaur footprints. The boulders are being ripped
up from strata at the base of the damâ€™s spillway. Both
localities will be suitable for families and involve
short walks. The access water in mid July will likely
be welcome too! There are many great campsites immediately adjacent to these localities. Please note this
is a single-day trip. Raymond is about a 3-hour drive
from Calgary (or 30 mins from Lethbridge). The fee
is $10.

Due to the size of the site, this field trip will be capped at 30 participants. Please register early to avoid disappointment!
