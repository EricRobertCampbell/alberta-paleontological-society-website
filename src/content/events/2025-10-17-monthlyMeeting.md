**Tako Koning, Consulting Geologist** - "Joggins, Nova Scotia" [Abstract & Bio](/presentationAbstracts/2025/takoKoningAbstract.pdf)

## Abstract

The Joggins Fossils Cliffs has been described in the literature as a “Coal Age Galapogos” (Calder, 2017). The world-famous fossils-rich cliffs at Joggins have been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for their outstanding geological story of the “Coal Age”. Approximately 320 million years ago, the continents were assembled into one huge land mass, the supercontinent Pangea and tropic rainforests covered the region. From fossilized trees that stood 30 meters high to the remains of the earliest known reptile, Hylonomus lyelli, Joggins Fossil Cliffs hold essential information about the development of life on earth during the Carboniferous. The fossil cliffs reveal the world’s most complete record of terrestrial life during the Carboniferous. The cliffs are still actively evolving – the powerful tides from the Bay of Fundy continue to erode the rock face so that new fossils come to light every year (Calder, 2017, Joggins Fossils Cliffs Field Guide, 2024).
