The field of scanning fossils has been booming recently! Fossil scans have been used to digitize collections, create 3D models, and even to study the internal anatomy of fossils. This workshop will cover the basics of scanning fossils, including the different types of scanners, how to prepare fossils for scanning, and how to process the data. The workshop will also include a hands-on scanning session, where participants can practice scanning fossils themselves.

Dr. Emily Bamforth and Jackson Sweder of the [Philip J. Currie Museum](https://dinomuseum.ca/) and Atharva Roy ([APS](/)) will be leading the workshop.
