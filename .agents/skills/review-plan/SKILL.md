description: Skeptically review an APS website implementation plan for missing requirements, architectural mistakes, overly narrow solutions, and over-engineering. Use when the user runs /review-plan or asks for a review of .ai/plans. Do not start implementation.

# Review plan

Review the plan as a skeptical senior engineer. Look for ways it can fail. Do not rewrite it into a second implementation, and do not edit application code.

## Inputs

Read the planning directory, usually `.ai/plans/<feature-slug>/`:

- `plan.md`
- `findings.md`
- `checklist.md`
- `decisions.md` when present
- The requirements file named by the plan, usually `.ai/requirements/<feature-slug>.md`

Then read the repository code, architecture docs, and ADRs the plan depends on (`readme/architecture/`, `readme/adr/`, project `README.md`, API README when relevant). Check claims in `findings.md` against the code. A plan that cites a pattern the repo does not have is a finding.

## Review

### Requirements

Look for missing requirements, incorrect assumptions, scope ambiguity, missing acceptance criteria, and open questions that should be answered before implementation.

### Architecture

Look for inconsistency with the Astro SSR + content-collections architecture, duplication, unnecessary new abstractions, incorrect page/component/utility boundaries, API contract problems, schema migration concerns, timezone mistakes, and backwards compatibility issues.

### Implementation completeness

Look for missing files, components, content entries, or modules, missing dependencies, missing error handling, missing edge cases, and missing integration work.

### Testing

Look for missing Vitest coverage, tests planned far from the module under change, missing regression coverage, acceptance criteria that cannot be verified, and checklists that implement before writing the failing adjacent test for behaviour changes. Follow the test severity in [findings.md](../code-review/references/findings.md): a missing test is Medium only when it can hide a regression.

### Security

Look for XSS, unsafe URLs or paths, weak API validation, secrets exposure, and unsafe embeds or raw HTML.

### Maintainability

Look for unnecessary complexity, duplication, inconsistency with repository conventions, and avoidable technical debt.

## Generalization

Ask whether the plan solves only the exact current case when a more general solution would be easier to understand, fit the existing abstractions, and provide real reuse at little extra cost.

Flag that only when all four are true:

1. **Understandable.** The general solution is equally understandable, or easier to understand. Do not recommend an abstraction that makes the code harder to follow.
2. **Fits the architecture.** It matches existing patterns, aligns with existing abstractions, reduces duplication, and improves consistency.
3. **Small extra cost.** It does not meaningfully increase implementation, testing, or maintenance effort.
4. **Evidence of reuse.** Similar implementations already exist, a neighbouring feature shows the same shape, a pattern is repeated, or the plan partially duplicates an existing abstraction.

Do not recommend generalization because a hypothetical future requirement might exist.

Appropriate: the plan adds one-off date parsing for one page, while `src/utility/dates.ts` already covers the case. Recommend extending that utility.

Inappropriate: recommending a CMS or plugin system because there might someday be more content types. Record that under Not Recommended when it appears in the plan or is tempting.

Also flag the opposite problem: a new framework or extension point whose only justification is a hypothetical future requirement.

## Output

Write `.ai/plans/<feature-slug>/plan-review.md`:

```markdown

## Recommendation
```

Use **Blocking Issues** for problems that make implementation unsafe or likely to miss the requirement. Use **Important Issues** for problems that should be fixed in the plan first. Explain why a recommended generalization is warranted. Keep this document's headings. The Critical / High / Medium / Low scale belongs to code review, not to this file. A test gap stays under Missing Tests and follows the Medium rule in findings.md.

Set the recommendation to one of: approve, revise the plan, or re-run `/plan-feature`.

Update `Status` in `plan.md` to `Reviewed`. Leave the plan's approach in place; suggested edits belong in this review. Do not mark the plan `Approved`.

Do not begin implementation. The next step is human approval, then [implement-feature](../implement-feature/SKILL.md).
